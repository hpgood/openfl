/**
 * The Stage class represents the main drawing area.
 *
 * <p>For SWF content running in the browser(in Flash<sup>®</sup> Player),
 * the Stage represents the entire area where Flash content is shown. For
 * content running in AIR on desktop operating systems, each NativeWindow
 * object has a corresponding Stage object.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Stage object is not globally accessible. You need to access it
 * through the <code>stage</code> property of a DisplayObject instance.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Stage class has several ancestor classes  -  DisplayObjectContainer,
 * InteractiveObject, DisplayObject, and EventDispatcher  -  from which it
 * inherits properties and methods. Many of these properties and methods are
 * either inapplicable to Stage objects, or require security checks when
 * called on a Stage object. The properties and methods that require security
 * checks are documented as part of the Stage class.</p>
 *
 * <p>In addition, the following inherited properties are inapplicable to
 * Stage objects. If you try to set them, an IllegalOperationError is thrown.
 * These properties may always be read, but since they cannot be set, they
 * will always contain default values.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>accessibilityProperties</code></li>
 *   <li><code>alpha</code></li>
 *   <li><code>blendMode</code></li>
 *   <li><code>cacheAsBitmap</code></li>
 *   <li><code>contextMenu</code></li>
 *   <li><code>filters</code></li>
 *   <li><code>focusRect</code></li>
 *   <li><code>loaderInfo</code></li>
 *   <li><code>mask</code></li>
 *   <li><code>mouseEnabled</code></li>
 *   <li><code>name</code></li>
 *   <li><code>opaqueBackground</code></li>
 *   <li><code>rotation</code></li>
 *   <li><code>scale9Grid</code></li>
 *   <li><code>scaleX</code></li>
 *   <li><code>scaleY</code></li>
 *   <li><code>scrollRect</code></li>
 *   <li><code>tabEnabled</code></li>
 *   <li><code>tabIndex</code></li>
 *   <li><code>transform</code></li>
 *   <li><code>visible</code></li>
 *   <li><code>x</code></li>
 *   <li><code>y</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Some events that you might expect to be a part of the Stage class, such
 * as <code>enterFrame</code>, <code>exitFrame</code>,
 * <code>frameConstructed</code>, and <code>render</code>, cannot be Stage
 * events because a reference to the Stage object cannot be guaranteed to
 * exist in every situation where these events are used. Because these events
 * cannot be dispatched by the Stage object, they are instead dispatched by
 * every DisplayObject instance, which means that you can add an event
 * listener to any DisplayObject instance to listen for these events. These
 * events, which are part of the DisplayObject class, are called broadcast
 * events to differentiate them from events that target a specific
 * DisplayObject instance. Two other broadcast events, <code>activate</code>
 * and <code>deactivate</code>, belong to DisplayObject's superclass,
 * EventDispatcher. The <code>activate</code> and <code>deactivate</code>
 * events behave similarly to the DisplayObject broadcast events, except that
 * these two events are dispatched not only by all DisplayObject instances,
 * but also by all EventDispatcher instances and instances of other
 * EventDispatcher subclasses. For more information on broadcast events, see
 * the DisplayObject class.</p>
 * 
 * @event fullScreen             Dispatched when the Stage object enters, or
 *                               leaves, full-screen mode. A change in
 *                               full-screen mode can be initiated through
 *                               ActionScript, or the user invoking a keyboard
 *                               shortcut, or if the current focus leaves the
 *                               full-screen window.
 * @event mouseLeave             Dispatched by the Stage object when the
 *                               pointer moves out of the stage area. If the
 *                               mouse button is pressed, the event is not
 *                               dispatched.
 * @event orientationChange      Dispatched by the Stage object when the stage
 *                               orientation changes.
 *
 *                               <p>Orientation changes can occur when the
 *                               user rotates the device, opens a slide-out
 *                               keyboard, or when the
 *                               <code>setAspectRatio()</code> is called.</p>
 *

 *                               orientation does not change when a device is
 *                               rotated. Thus, StageOrientationEvents are
 *                               only dispatched for device rotation when
 *                               <code>autoOrients</code> is

 * @event orientationChanging    Dispatched by the Stage object when the stage
 *                               orientation begins changing.
 *
 *                               <p><b>Important:</b> orientationChanging
 *                               events are not dispatched on Android
 *                               devices.</p>
 *
 *                               <p><b>Note:</b> If the
 *                               <code>autoOrients</code> property is
 *                               <code>false</code>, then the stage
 *                               orientation does not change when a device is
 *                               rotated. Thus, StageOrientationEvents are
 *                               only dispatched for device rotation when

 *                               property of the Stage object is set to
 *                               <code>StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE</code> and the

	/**
	 * Indicates whether GPU compositing is available and in use. The
	 * <code>wmodeGPU</code> value is <code>true</code> <i>only</i> when all
	 * three of the following conditions exist:
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>GPU compositing has been requested.</li>
	 *   <li>GPU compositing is available.</li>
	 *   <li>GPU compositing is in use.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <p>Specifically, the <code>wmodeGPU</code> property indicates one of the
	 * following:</p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * <ol>
	 *   <li>GPU compositing has not been requested or is unavailable. In this
	 * case, the <code>wmodeGPU</code> property value is <code>false</code>.</li>
	 *   <li>GPU compositing has been requested(if applicable and available),
	 * but the environment is operating in "fallback mode"(not optimal
	 * rendering) due to limitations of the content. In this case, the
	 * <code>wmodeGPU</code> property value is <code>true</code>.</li>
	 *   <li>GPU compositing has been requested(if applicable and available),
	 * and the environment is operating in the best mode. In this case, the
	 * <code>wmodeGPU</code> property value is also <code>true</code>.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <p>In other words, the <code>wmodeGPU</code> property identifies the
	 * capability and state of the rendering environment. For runtimes that do
	 * not support GPU compositing, such as AIR 1.5.2, the value is always
	 * <code>false</code>, because(as stated above) the value is
	 * <code>true</code> only when GPU compositing has been requested, is
	 * available, and is in use.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>The <code>wmodeGPU</code> property is useful to determine, at runtime,
	 * whether or not GPU compositing is in use. The value of
	 * <code>wmodeGPU</code> indicates if your content is going to be scaled by
	 * hardware, or not, so you can present graphics at the correct size. You can
	 * also determine if you're rendering in a fast path or not, so that you can
	 * adjust your content complexity accordingly.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>For Flash Player in a browser, GPU compositing can be requested by the
	 * value of <code>gpu</code> for the <code>wmode</code> HTML parameter in the
	 * page hosting the SWF file. For other configurations, GPU compositing can
	 * be requested in the header of a SWF file(set using SWF authoring
	 * tools).</p>
	 *
	 * <p>However, the <code>wmodeGPU</code> property does not identify the
	 * current rendering performance. Even if GPU compositing is "in use" the
	 * rendering process might not be operating in the best mode. To adjust your
	 * content for optimal rendering, use a Flash runtime debugger version, and
	 * set the <code>DisplayGPUBlendsetting</code> in your mm.cfg file.</p>
	 *
	 * <p><b>Note:</b> This property is always <code>false</code> when referenced
	 * from ActionScript that runs before the runtime performs its first
	 * rendering pass. For example, if you examine <code>wmodeGPU</code> from a
	 * script in Frame 1 of Adobe Flash Professional, and your SWF file is the
	 * first SWF file loaded in a new instance of the runtime, then the
	 * <code>wmodeGPU</code> value is <code>false</code>. To get an accurate
	 * value, wait until at least one rendering pass has occurred. If you write
	 * an event listener for the <code>exitFrame</code> event of any
	 * <code>DisplayObject</code>, the <code>wmodeGPU</code> value at is the
	 * correct value.</p>
